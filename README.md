## What this application does

This is a responsive website, that could be used to order food for delivery. The application works both web or mobile.

## What I've learned

* tailwind -
with this project I could learn a lot about tailwind. At the begining it was a bit weird, but at the end of the project a I was very confortable using tailwind.
* react components -
I've created some componentes that the original  project didn't have: "the title component" and the "button component" used to filter the food categories. 
* react props - 
I've used react props to create the "title component" in order to white different titles
* react hooks - 
the react hook "UseState" is used in this project to change images at the main banner and to filter the food categories at the "Our Meal" section.
* design -
in order to improve the layout of this project I've changed some colors and create some hover effects that the original project didn't have. Also, I've change a bit the footer structure.
