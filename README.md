# React Food Delivery Website

## What this application does

This is a responsive website, that could be used to order food for delivery. The application works both web or mobile.

You can check the aplication <a href="https://cintiabsza.github.io/react-fooddelivery-app/">here 

## What I've learned and What I've changed on the original project

* tailwind -
with this project I could learn a lot about tailwind. At the begining it was a bit weird, but at the end of the project a I was very confortable using tailwind.
* react components -
I've created some componentes that the original  project didn't have: "the title component" to write the titles and the "button component" used to filter the food categories. Using this components give me the ability to change in just one place lots of configurations in elements that will be reapeted during the app. 
* react props - 
I've used react props to create the "title component" in order to write all the different titles that are needed. 
* design -
in order to improve the layout of this project I've changed some colors and create some hover effects that the original project didn't have. Also, I've change a bit the footer structure.
