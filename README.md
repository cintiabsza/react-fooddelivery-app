# React Food Delivery App

## What this application does:

This is a responsive website, that could be used to order food for delivery. The application works both web or mobile.

You can check the aplication <a href="https://cintiabsza.github.io/react-fooddelivery-app/">here 

## What I've learned and what I've changed from the original project:

* tailwind -
with this project I could learn a lot about tailwind. At the begining it was a bit weird, but at the end of the project I was very confortable using it. Also, I've found so easy to buil responsive apps with tailwind. 
* react components -
I've created some componentes that the original  project didn't have: "the title component" to write all the app titles and the "button component" used to filter food categories. Using this components give me the ability to change manipulate easily all configurations used by elements that are reapeted in the app. 
* react props - 
I've used react props to create the "title component" in order to write all the different titles that are needed. 
* design -
in order to improve the layout of this project, I've changed some colors and created some hover effects that the original project didn't have. Also, I've changed a bit the footer structure.

## Credits:

The original version of this project was developed by <a href="https://github.com/ehizeex"> @ehizeex. 

I've reproduced the code and I've made basic changes in order to study react aplications.
